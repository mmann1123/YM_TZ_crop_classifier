Comments to the Author
This paper addresses several important challenges in developing efficient crop-type classification models using the traditional machine-learning approach in data-scarce environments, including the scarcity of training datasets collected from crop fields, especially in developing countries. Combining the dataset collected from crop fields with the imagery datasets extracted using filter-based methods is crucial for achieving high classification accuracy. Crowdsourced data collected by volunteers can serve as a potential alternative, but these data are typically lack proper validation. To address this issue, the author proposes a novel methodology leveraging KoboToolbox, YouthMappers participants, and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, among others, to extract and validate crowdsourced data and time-series imagery features. The authors also propose a traditional machine learning-based classification model that utilizes the integrated dataset of time-series features with crowdsourced, field-validated crop-type labels to validate their approach. The proposed methods show promise by achieving high classification accuracy, evidenced by a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.82 and an F1-micro score of 0.85.

Strengths:
-The paper is well-structured and follows a clear and logical progression.
-The authors provide a significant introduction and background, giving insight into the challenges that limit the implementation of an efficient crop-type classification.
-The authors contribute to proposing novel methods for extracting and validating crowdsourced data.

Minor correction:
- Ensure that reference 25 fits within the column width.
- The sentence refers to "as seen in the crop calendar in Figure 2 below" Fig 2; However, the figure is displayed above the sentence, not below.

Comments to the Author
This study introduces a novel approach to traditional machine learning methodology for crop type classification in Tanzania, by integrating crowdsourced data with time-series features extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Overall, the content of the paper is presented too succinctly and requires further refinement in expression, particularly in the description of data and methodology, the presentation of results and figures, as well as the discussion section, which is currently lacking.

It is recommended to divide Section II (DATA & METHODS) into two separate sections. A schematic diagram should be provided to illustrate the data, especially the crowdsourced data. In the methodology section, a flowchart should be added, along with an accuracy evaluation component.

The conclusion section is also overly concise. For instance, in Part B (Land Cover and Crop Type), a more detailed description of Figure 3 is suggested.

It is advisable to present the Discussion as an independent section and enrich its content.

Whether to use a colon after figure titles (e.g., “Fig. 6:”) should strictly follow the journal’s formatting guidelines.

The font size in the figures is too small and lacks clarity, as seen in Figure 7.

It is recommended to include comparative experiments with other methods.

It is suggested to add visualizations and descriptions of the classification results.
