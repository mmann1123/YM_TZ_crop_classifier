  abstract = {In this article, we revisit the relationship among institutions, human capital, and development. We argue that empirical models that treat institutions and human capital as exogenous are misspecified, both because of the usual omitted variable bias problems and because of differential measurement error in these variables, and that this misspecification is at the root of the very large returns of human capital, about four to five times greater than that implied by micro (Mincerian) estimates, found in the previous literature. Using cross-country and cross-regional regressions, we show that when we focus on historically determined differences in human capital and control for the effect of institutions, the impact of institutions on long-run development is robust, whereas the estimates of the effect of human capital are much diminished and become consistent with micro estimates. Using historical and cross-country regression evidence, we also show that there is no support for the view that differences in the human capital endowments of early European colonists have been a major factor in the subsequent institutional development of former colonies.},

  abstract = {Background Fast weight gain and linear growth in children in low-income and middle-income countries are associated with enhanced survival and improved cognitive development, but might increase risk of obesity and related adult cardiometabolic diseases. We investigated how linear growth and relative weight gain during infancy and childhood are related to health and human capital outcomes in young adults. Methods We used data from five prospective birth cohort studies from Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa. We investigated body-mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma glucose concentration, height, years of attained schooling, and related categorical indicators of adverse outcomes in young adults. With linear and logistic regression models, we assessed how these outcomes relate to birthweight and to statistically independent measures representing linear growth and weight gain independent of linear growth (relative weight gain) in three age periods: 0--2 years, 2 years to mid-childhood, and mid-childhood to adulthood. Findings We obtained data for 8362 participants who had at least one adult outcome of interest. A higher birthweight was consistently associated with an adult body-mass index of greater than 25 kg/m2 (odds ratio 1{$\cdot$}28, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}21--1{$\cdot$}35) and a reduced likelihood of short adult stature (0{$\cdot$}49, 0{$\cdot$}44--0{$\cdot$}54) and of not completing secondary school (0{$\cdot$}82, 0{$\cdot$}78--0{$\cdot$}87). Faster linear growth was strongly associated with a reduced risk of short adult stature (age 2 years: 0{$\cdot$}23, 0{$\cdot$}20--0{$\cdot$}52; mid-childhood: 0{$\cdot$}39, 0{$\cdot$}36--0{$\cdot$}43) and of not completing secondary school (age 2 years: 0{$\cdot$}74, 0{$\cdot$}67--0{$\cdot$}78; mid-childhood: 0{$\cdot$}87, 0{$\cdot$}83--0{$\cdot$}92), but did raise the likelihood of overweight (age 2 years: 1{$\cdot$}24, 1{$\cdot$}17--1{$\cdot$}31; mid-childhood: 1{$\cdot$}12, 1{$\cdot$}06--1{$\cdot$}18) and elevated blood pressure (age 2 years: 1{$\cdot$}12, 1{$\cdot$}06--1{$\cdot$}19; mid-childhood: 1{$\cdot$}07, 1{$\cdot$}01--1{$\cdot$}13). Faster relative weight gain was associated with an increased risk of adult overweight (age 2 years: 1{$\cdot$}51, 1{$\cdot$}43--1{$\cdot$}60; mid-childhood: 1{$\cdot$}76, 1{$\cdot$}69--1{$\cdot$}91) and elevated blood pressure (age 2 years: 1{$\cdot$}07, 1{$\cdot$}01--1{$\cdot$}13; mid-childhood: 1{$\cdot$}22, 1{$\cdot$}15--1{$\cdot$}30). Linear growth and relative weight gain were not associated with dysglycaemia, but a higher birthweight was associated with decreased risk of the disorder (0{$\cdot$}89, 0{$\cdot$}81--0{$\cdot$}98). Interpretation Interventions in countries of low and middle income to increase birthweight and linear growth during the first 2 years of life are likely to result in substantial gains in height and schooling and give some protection from adult chronic disease risk factors, with few adverse trade-offs.

  abstract = {Background Undernutrition among children under the age of five is a major public health concern, especially in developing countries. This study aimed to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict undernutrition and identify its associated factors. Methods Secondary data analysis of the 2017 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) was performed using R and Python. The main outcomes of interest were undernutrition (stunting: height-for-age (HAZ) {$<$} -2 SD; wasting: weight-for-height (WHZ) {$<$} -2 SD; and underweight: weight-for-age (WAZ) {$<$} -2 SD). Seven ML algorithms were trained and tested: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic model, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), ridge regression, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The ML models were evaluated using the accuracy, confusion matrix, and area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Results In total, 8564 children were included in the final analysis. The average age of the children was 926 days, and the majority were females. The weighted prevalence rates of stunting, wasting, and underweight were 17\%, 7\%, and 12\%, respectively. The accuracies of all the ML models for wasting were (LDA: 84\%; Logistic: 95\%; SVM: 92\%; RF: 94\%; LASSO: 96\%; Ridge: 84\%, XGBoost: 98\%), stunting (LDA: 86\%; Logistic: 86\%; SVM: 98\%; RF: 88\%; LASSO: 86\%; Ridge: 86\%, XGBoost: 98\%), and for underweight were (LDA: 90\%; Logistic: 92\%; SVM: 98\%; RF: 89\%; LASSO: 92\%; Ridge: 88\%, XGBoost: 98\%). The AUC values of the wasting models were (LDA: 99\%; Logistic: 100\%; SVM: 72\%; RF: 94\%; LASSO: 99\%; Ridge: 59\%, XGBoost: 100\%), for stunting were (LDA: 89\%; Logistic: 90\%; SVM: 100\%; RF: 92\%; LASSO: 90\%; Ridge: 89\%, XGBoost: 100\%), and for underweight were (LDA: 95\%; Logistic: 96\%; SVM: 100\%; RF: 94\%; LASSO: 96\%; Ridge: 82\%, XGBoost: 82\%). Age, weight, length/height, sex, region of residence and ethnicity were important predictors of wasting, stunting and underweight. Conclusion The XGBoost model was the best model for predicting wasting, stunting, and underweight. The findings showed that different ML algorithms could be useful for predicting undernutrition and identifying important predictors for targeted interventions among children under five years in Ghana.},

In contrast, the nature and magnitude of post-disaster losses remain largely unknown because they are not easily observable.  Here we exploit annual variation in the incidence of typhoons (West-Pacific hurricanes) to identify post-disaster losses within Filipino households.  We find that unearned income and excess infant mortality in the year after typhoon exposure outnumber immediate damages and death tolls roughly 15-to-1.  Typhoons destroy durable assets and depress incomes, leading to broad expenditure reductions achieved in part through disinvestments in health and human capital. Infant mortality mirrors these economic responses, and additional findings -- that only female infants are at risk, that sibling competition elevates risk, and that infants conceived after a typhoon are also at risk -- indicate that this excess mortality results from household decisions made while coping with post-disaster economic conditions.  We estimate that these post-typhoon "economic deaths" constitute 13\% of the overall infant mortality rate in the Philippines.  Taken together, these results indicate that economic and human losses due to environmental disaster may be an order of magnitude larger than previously thought and that adaptive decision-making may amplify, rather than dampen, disasters' social cost.},

Warmer El Ni{\~n}o conditions predict worse child undernutrition in most of the developing world, but better outcomes in the small number of areas where precipitation is positively affected by warmer ENSO. ENSO's contemporaneous effects on child weight loss are detectable years later as decreases in height. This relationship looks similar at both global and regional scale, and has not appreciably weakened over the last four decades. Results imply that almost 6 million additional children were underweight during the 2015 El Ni{\~n}o compared to a counterfactual of neutral ENSO conditions in 2015. This demonstrates a pathway through which human well-being remains subject to predictable climatic processes.},

The existence of these deficits is a key driver of inequality and contributes to the intergenerational transmission of poverty.

The authors argue that famine occurrences are linked to historical and contemporary socioeconomic processes that have increased over time the vulnerability of African households to hunger and reduced their resilience to environmental and economic shocks, political conflict, and the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS. Approaches to famine need to move away from the ``emergency relief'' framework to better address the underlying conditions that make food shortages endemic. Future food security for Africa requires an integrated long-term response to household vulnerability on the part of African governments, civil society, and international partners by incorporating new technologies, local expertise, and active involvement of African communities living with the realities of recurrent famine.},

In this study, we estimate predictive algorithms for the determinants of childhood stunting by using various machine learning (ML) algorithms.Design:This study draws on data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey of 2016. Five ML algorithms including eXtreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), random forest, neural network and the generalised linear models were considered to predict the socio-demographic risk factors for undernutrition in Ethiopia.Setting:Households in Ethiopia.Participants:A total of 9471 children below 5 years of age participated in this study.Results:The descriptive results show substantial regional variations in child stunting, wasting and underweight in Ethiopia. Also, among the five ML algorithms, xgbTree algorithm shows a better prediction ability than the generalised linear mixed algorithm. The best predicting algorithm (xgbTree) shows diverse important predictors of undernutrition across the three outcomes which include time to water source, anaemia history, child age greater than 30 months, small birth size and maternal underweight, among others.Conclusions:The xgbTree algorithm was a reasonably superior ML algorithm for predicting childhood undernutrition in Ethiopia compared to other ML algorithms considered in this study. The findings support improvement in access to water supply, food security and fertility regulation, among others, in the quest to considerably improve childhood nutrition in Ethiopia.},

I find negative deviations in rainfall from the long-term mean to have negative and highly significant effects on female enrollment in primary schools and the effect grows stronger for older girls. I find no effect of rainfall variation on the enrollment of boys and young girls. Moreover, I find that when schooling is free of charge and both marginal boys and girls are enrolled, a negative income shock has an adverse effect on the test scores of female students while boys are not affected. The results imply that households respond to income shocks by varying the amount of schooling and resources provided to girls while boys are to a large extent sheltered --- a finding consistent with a model where parents' values of child labor differ across sexes.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}BACKGROUND{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Accurate and comprehensive measurements of a range of sustainable development outcomes are fundamental inputs into both research and policy. For instance, good measures are needed to monitor progress toward sustainability goals and evaluate interventions designed to improve development outcomes. Traditional approaches to measurement of many key outcomes rely on household surveys that are conducted infrequently in many parts of the world and are often of low accuracy. The paucity of ground data stands in contrast to the rapidly growing abundance and quality of satellite imagery. Multiple public and private sensors launched in recent years provide temporal, spatial, and spectral information on changes happening on Earth's surface.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Here we review a rapidly growing scientific literature that seeks to use this satellite imagery to measure and understand various outcomes related to sustainable development. We pay particular attention to recent approaches that use methods from artificial intelligence to extract information from images, as these methods typically outperform earlier approaches and enable new insights. Our focus is on settings and applications where humans themselves, or what they produce, are the outcome of interest and on where these outcomes are being measured using satellite imagery.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}ADVANCES{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We describe and synthesize the variety of approaches that have been used to extract information from satellite imagery, with particular attention given to recent machine learning--based approaches and settings in which training data are limited or noisy. We then quantitatively assess predictive performance of these approaches in the domains of smallholder agriculture, economic livelihoods, population, and informal settlements. We show that satellite-based performance in predicting these outcomes is reasonably strong and improving. Performance improvements have come through a combination of more numerous and accurate training data, more abundant and higher-quality imagery, and creative application of advances in computer vision to satellite inputs and sustainability outcomes. Further, our analyses suggest that reported model performance likely understates true performance in many settings, given the noisy data on which predictions are evaluated and the types of noise typically observed in sustainability applications. For multiple outcomes of interest, satellite-based estimates can now equal or exceed the accuracy of traditional approaches to outcome measurement. We describe multiple methods through which the true performance of satellite-based approaches can be better understood.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Integration of satellite-based sustainability measurements into research has been broad, and we describe applications in agriculture, fisheries, health, and economics. Documented uses of these measurements in public-sector decision-making are rarer, which we attribute in part to the novelty of the approaches, their lack of interpretability, and the potential benefits to some policy-makers of not having certain outcomes be measured.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}OUTLOOK{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The largest constraint to satellite-based model performance is now training data rather than imagery. While imagery has become abundant, the scarcity and frequent unreliability of ground data make both training and validation of satellite-based models difficult. Expanding the quantity and quality of such data will quickly accelerate progress in this field. Other opportunities for advancement include improvements in model interpretability, fusion of satellites with other nontraditional data that provide complementary information, and more-rigorous evaluation of satellite-based approaches (relative to available alternatives) in the context of specific use cases.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Nevertheless, despite the current and future promise of satellite-based approaches, we argue that these approaches will amplify rather than replace existing ground-based data collection efforts in most settings. Many outcomes of interest will likely never be accurately estimated with satellites; for outcomes where satellites do have predictive power, high-quality local training data can nearly always improve model performance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The direct impacts can be horrific, but what are the longer-term effects of such shocks on households and their livelihoods? Under what circumstances will shocks push households into poverty traps from which recovery may not be possible without external assistance? In an effort to answer these questions, this paper analyzes the asset dynamics of Ethiopian and Honduran households in the wake of severe environmental shocks. While the patterns are different across countries, both reveal worlds in which the poorest households struggle most with shocks, adopting coping strategies which are costly in terms of both short term and long-term well being.},

  abstract = {With an increasing global population, accurate and timely population counts are essential for urban planning and disaster management. Previous research using contextual features, using mainly very-high-spatial-resolution imagery ({$<$}2 m spatial resolution) at subnational to city scales, has found strong correlations with population and poverty. Contextual features can be defined as the statistical quantification of edge patterns, pixel groups, gaps, textures, and the raw spectral signatures calculated over groups of pixels or neighborhoods. While they correlated with population and poverty, which components of the human-modified landscape were captured by the contextual features have not been investigated. Additionally, previous research has focused on more costly, less frequently acquired very-high-spatial-resolution imagery. Therefore, contextual features from both very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and lower-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) imagery in Sri Lanka, Belize, and Accra, Ghana were calculated, and those outputs were correlated with OpenStreetMap building and road metrics. These relationships were compared to determine what components of the human-modified landscape the features capture, and how spatial resolution and location impact the predictive power of these relationships. The results suggest that contextual features can map urban attributes well, with out-of-sample R2 values up to 93\%. Moreover, the degradation of spatial resolution did not significantly reduce the results, and for some urban attributes, the results actually improved. Based on these results, the ability of the lower resolution Sentinel-2 data to predict the population density of the smallest census units available was then assessed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-2 contextual features explained up to 84\% of the out-of-sample variation for population density.},

While understandable, this growing focus has perhaps obscured the impact of other variables affecting malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa, i.e. the long-term impact of agricultural policies on food supply and prices, large and persistent seasonal variations in food prices, and the impact of famines which still affect parts of the continent. This paper focuses on the relative impact of these factors on child malnutrition (measured by the number of child admissions to feeding centres) in Malawi and Niger, two countries which closely represent the situation of other small, landlocked, subsistence agricultural economies facing severe food security problems. Our analysis shows that in these countries the drivers of changes in domestic staple prices and child malnutrition are related not only -- or not primarily -- to variations of international food prices but also to the impact of agricultural policies on food production and prices, in a persistent food price seasonality, and in recurrent and poorly managed famines. These factors can exert a strong upward pressure on food prices and child malnutrition even during years of falling international prices.},

We begin with a brief overview of the theory which illustrates that evidence of a causal relationship between a shock in early childhood and a future outcome says little about whether the relationship in question is biological or immutable. We then survey recent work which shows that events before five years old can have large long term impacts on adult outcomes. Child and family characteristics measured at school entry do as much to explain future outcomes as factors that labor economists have more traditionally focused on, such as years of education. Yet while children can be permanently damaged at this age, an important message is that the damage can often be remediated. We provide a brief overview of evidence regarding the effectiveness of different types of policies to provide remediation. We conclude with a list of some of the many outstanding questions for future research.},

  abstract = {The Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset builds on previous approaches to `smart' interpolation techniques and high resolution, long period of record precipitation estimates based on infrared Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) observations. The algorithm i) is built around a 0.05{$^\circ$} climatology that incorporates satellite information to represent sparsely gauged locations, ii) incorporates daily, pentadal, and monthly 1981-present 0.05{$^\circ$} CCD-based precipitation estimates, iii) blends station data to produce a preliminary information product with a latency of about 2 days and a final product with an average latency of about 3 weeks, and iv) uses a novel blending procedure incorporating the spatial correlation structure of CCD-estimates to assign interpolation weights. We present the CHIRPS algorithm, global and regional validation results, and show how CHIRPS can be used to quantify the hydrologic impacts of decreasing precipitation and rising air temperatures in the Greater Horn of Africa. Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, we show that CHIRPS can support effective hydrologic forecasts and trend analyses in southeastern Ethiopia.},

It shows that the commonly used dummy variable or moving average deviation methods to estimate the seasonal gap can yield substantial upward bias. This can be partially circumvented using trigonometric and sawtooth models, which are more parsimonious. Among staple crops, seasonality is highest for maize (33 percent on average) and lowest for rice (16{$\frac{1}{2}$} percent). This is two and a half to three times larger than in the international reference markets. Seasonality varies substantially across market places but maize is the only crop in which there are important systematic country effects. Malawi, where maize is the main staple, emerges as exhibiting the most acute seasonal differences. Reaching the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger requires renewed policy attention to seasonality in food prices and consumption. {\copyright} 2016},

The analysis uses a unique data set with 10 years of recall data on school attendance and household shocks. We find that the probability of a child dropping out of school increases significantly when the household experiences an illness, death or asset shock. We propose a test to distinguish whether the impact of shocks on school attendance can be attributed to credit constraints, labour market rigidities, or a combination of the two. The results suggest that credit constraints, rather than labour market rigidities, explain the inability of households in Madagascar to keep their children in school during times of economic stress.},

Comparable analyses of attainment exist only at the national level, potentially obscuring patterns in subnational inequality. Evidence suggests that wide disparities between urban and rural populations exist, raising questions about where the majority of progress towards the education targets of the Sustainable Development Goals is occurring in African countries. Here we explore within-country inequalities by predicting years of schooling across five by five kilometre grids, generating estimates of average educational attainment by age and sex at subnational levels. Despite marked progress in attainment from 2000 to 2015 across Africa, substantial differences persist between locations and sexes. These differences have widened in many countries, particularly across the Sahel. These high-resolution, comparable estimates improve the ability of decision-makers to plan the precisely targeted interventions that will be necessary to deliver progress during the era of the Sustainable Development Goals.},

In sub-Saharan Africa, 1 in 7 children dies before age 5 y, and more than a third of these deaths are attributed to malnutrition. The main purpose of this study was to develop a majority voting--based hybrid ensemble (MVBHE) learning model to accelerate the prediction accuracy of malnutrition data of under-five children in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods This study used available under-five nutritional secondary data from the Demographic and Health Surveys performed in sub-Saharan African countries. The research used bagging, boosting, and voting algorithms, such as random forest, decision tree, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and k-nearest neighbors machine learning methods, to generate the MVBHE model. Results We evaluated the model performances in contrast to each other using different measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. The results of the experiment showed that the MVBHE model (96\%) was better at predicting malnutrition than the random forest (81\%), decision tree (60\%), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (79\%), and k-nearest neighbors (74\%). Conclusions The random forest algorithm demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy (81\%) compared with the decision tree, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and k-nearest neighbors algorithms. The accuracy was then enhanced to 96\% using the MVBHE model. The MVBHE model is recommended by the present study as the best way to predict malnutrition in under-five children.},

  abstract = {Seasonal trends in tuberculosis (TB) notifications have been observed in several countries but are poorly understood. Explanatory factors may include weather, indoor crowding, seasonal respiratory infections and migration. Using enhanced citywide TB surveillance data collected over nine years in Blantyre, Malawi, we set out to investigate how weather and seasonality affect temporal trends in TB case notification rates (CNRs) across different demographic groups. We used data from prospective enhanced surveillance between April 2011 and December 2018, which systematically collected age, HIV status, sex and case notification dates for all registering TB cases in Blantyre. We retrieved temperature and rainfall data from the Global Surface Summary of the Day weather station database. We calculated weekly trends in TB CNRs, rainfall and temperature, and calculated 10-week moving averages. To investigate the associations between rainfall, temperature and TB CNRs, we fitted generalized linear models using a distributed lag nonlinear framework. The estimated Blantyre population increased from 1,068,151 in April 2011 to 1,264,304 in December 2018, with 15,908~TB cases recorded. Overall annual TB CNRs declined from 222 to 145 per 100,000 between 2012 and 2018, with the largest declines seen in HIV-positive people and adults aged over 20~years old. TB CNRs peaks occurred with increasing temperature in September and October before the onset of increased rainfall, and later in the rainy season during January-March, after sustained rainfall. When lag between a change in weather and TB case notifications was accounted for, higher average rainfall was associated with an equivalent six weeks of relatively lower TB notification rates, whereas there were no changes in TB CNR associated with change in average temperatures. TB CNRs in Blantyre have a seasonal pattern of two cyclical peaks per year, coinciding with the start and end of the rainy season. These trends may be explained by increased transmission at certain times of the year, by limited healthcare access, by patterns of seasonal respiratory infections precipitating cough and care-seeking, or by migratory patterns related to planting and harvesting during the rainy season.},

  abstract = {Early warning systems are essential tool for humanitarian preparedness and response. The diversity of inputs required, ranging from agricultural production estimates to market price variability and weather forecasts, means that interpreting food security signals is not an easy task. Each of these inputs is fraught with uncertainty which analysts need to assess when making projections about future food security. Understanding the accuracy rates of early warning systems is therefore of paramount importance to enable improvements to food security prediction. However, to date, limited analyses of early warning accuracy have been conducted. Here we analyze Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) early warning data for the Greater Horn of Africa and show that, despite accuracy in projections, there remain important challenges for food security projections. The two major sources of uncertainty are associated with complex weather phenomena and conflict -- with uncertainty in weather forecasts being twice as important as conflict in overall FEWS NET accuracy. Indeed, the least accurate projections are recorded in seasons with particularly complex weather events such as the 2015/2016 El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation as well as in zones that are affected by internal conflict (e.g. South Sudan). With respect to predicting crisis transitions, areas with more frequent transitions tend to be more accurate, possibly because predicting the drivers behind these transitions are better understood. Our novel analysis provides a framework to invest resources in specific aspects of early warning. We also hope that by measuring the reliability of these systems, we can increase the confidence of decision makers to act early to mitigate the growing risks posed by hunger and famine.},

Yet while countless hydrographic maps exist for well-known river basins and individual nations, there is a lack of seamless high-quality data on large scales such as continents or the entire globe. Data for many large international basins are patchy, and remote areas are often poorly mapped. In response to these limitations, a team of scientists has developed data and created maps of the world's rivers that provide the research community with more reliable information about where streams and watersheds occur on the Earth's surface and how water drains the landscape. The new product, known as HydroSHEDS (Hydrological Data and Maps Based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at Multiple Scales), provides this information at a resolution and quality unachieved by previous global data sets, such as HYDRO1k [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 2000].},

We develop a replicable, near real-time model incorporating spatially and temporally granular market data, remotely-sensed rainfall and geographic data, and demographic characteristics. We train the model on 2010--2011 data from Malawi and forecast 2013 food security. Our model correctly identifies the food security status of 83 to 99\% of the most food insecure village clusters in 2013, depending on the food security measure, while the prevailing approach correctly identifies between 0 and 10\%.

Higher early-life rainfall has large positive effects on the adult outcomes of women, but not of men. Women with 20 percent higher rainfall (relative to the local norm) are 0.57 centimeters taller, complete 0.22 more schooling grades, and live in households scoring 0.12 standard deviations higher on an asset index. Schooling attainment appears to mediate the impact on adult women's socioeconomic status. (JEL I12, I21, J16, O15)},

In this study, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption and of people using crisis or above-crisis food-based coping when primary data are not available. Making use of a unique global dataset, the proposed models can explain up to 81\% of the variation in insufficient food consumption and up to 73\% of the variation in crisis or above food-based coping levels. We also show that the proposed models can nowcast the food security situation in near real time and propose a method to identify which variables are driving the changes observed in predicted trends---which is key to make predictions serviceable to decision-makers.},

This paper analyzes the impacts of the floods that occurred during the 2014/15 growing season in Malawi, using a two-period panel data set. The results show that maize yields and value of production per capita were lower for all households, particularly for those located in moderate and severe flood areas. However, drops in food consumption expenditures were less dramatic, and calories per capita were higher. Only the food consumption score, which is a measure of dietary diversity, was significantly lower, particularly for households located in areas of severe flooding. Although access to social safety nets increased food consumption outcomes, particularly for those located in areas of moderate flooding, the proportion of households with access to certain safety net programs was lower in 2015 compared with 2013. The latter finding suggests that linking these programs more closely to disaster relief efforts could substantially improve welfare outcomes during and after a natural disaster. Finally, potential risk-coping strategies, proxied by access to off-farm income sources, having financial accounts, and social networks, were generally ineffective in mitigating the negative impacts of the floods.},

  abstract = {Cholera is endemic in many African countries with recurrent seasonal outbreaks in parts of the region. Malawi has been experiencing seasonal outbreaks of Cholera since 1998, and it is one of the major public health problems. The current cholera outbreak is one of Malawi's worst cholera outbreaks in the past 10 years. Since the beginning of the outbreak about 56,090 cumulative cases of cholera have been reported with 1712 deaths representing a case fatality rate of 3.1\%. This is happening when the country is recovering from the COVID-19 epidemic, the devastating effects of tropical storms, and is also tackling the polio outbreak. Clearly, the Malawian health system is overstretched. Nevertheless, the country has taken a positive step in responding to the current cholera outbreak. Setting up treatment facilities, stepping up Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) initiatives in impacted areas, and improving the surveillance system for early case detection and treatment are some of the actions taken. As the fight against cholera continues there is a need to significantly increase monitoring in all districts, particularly at the community level for early detection and control of the cholera. Considering there are some cross-border cases from neighboring countries such as Mozambique, good collaboration between the two countries in strengthening surveillance and hygiene practices in the borders will help in controlling the spread of the disease. While it is commendable that dozens of oral cholera vaccines have been given, it should be noted that this provides short-term prevention. In addressing the nation's ongoing and recurrent cholera outbreaks, we advise prioritizing WASH efforts in addition to oral cholera vaccine administration.},

After launch of Suomi NPP in October 2011 we observed a gray haze in radiance images with offsets up to 5{\texttimes}10\textsuperscript{-9} W cm\textsuperscript{-2} sr\textsuperscript{-1}. Overall this impacts about 25\% of nighttime scenes. We considered stray light as the likely cause, and studied calibration data from the space view. We concluded that stray light is likely entering the VIIRS scan cavity directly or indirectly through the nadir door and solar diffuser openings. We also studied the darkest earth scenes without any solar, lunar or artificial illumination, and found that the offset is a function of cross-track pixel, solar angle of incidence (AOI) and detector number. We observed a strong detector dependence causing striping. Dividing scenes into 3 or 4 zones in each hemisphere based on solar AOI, we devised an algorithmic correction based on polynomial fits of the medians of the data for each zone. The correction removed almost all the haze and striping and improved dynamic range by 2 orders-of-magnitude, to as low as 1{\texttimes}10\textsuperscript{-10 }Wcm\textsuperscript{-2} sr\textsuperscript{-1}, but some striping remains in the twilight region due to extrapolation.},

Given the finite resources allocated for emergency response, and the expected increase in incidences of humanitarian catastrophe due to changing climate patterns, there is a need for rigorous and efficient methods of early warning and emergency needs assessment. In this paper we develop an empirical model, based on a relatively parsimonious set of regularly measured variables from communities in Kenya's arid north, that generates remarkably accurate forecasts of the likelihood of famine with at least 3months lead time. Such a forecasting model is a potentially valuable tool for enhancing early warning capacity.},

  abstract = {Background: Malnutrition is an umbrella term that refers to an impairment in nutrition indicative of subsequently compromised human well-being. The term covers the full spectrum of nutritional impairments from a small yet detectable departure from a ``norm'' to a terminal stage when severe malnutrition could result in death. This broad spectrum of nutritional departures from ``the optimum'' dictates the need for an ensemble of metrics to capture the complexity of involved mechanisms, risk factors, precipitating events, short-term, and long-term consequences. Ideally, these metrics should be universally applicable to vulnerable populations, settings, ages, and times when people are most susceptible to malnutrition. We should be able to characterize and intervene to minimize the risk of malnutrition, especially child acute malnutrition that could be assessed by anthropometric measurements. Objectives: The main challenge in reaching such an ambitious goal is the complexity of measuring, characterizing, explaining, predicting, and preventing malnutrition at any dimension: temporal or spatial and at any scale: a person or a group. The expansive body of literature has been accumulated on many temporal aspects of malnutrition and seasonal changes in nutritional (anthropometric) status. The research community is now shifting their attention to predictive modeling of child malnutrition and its importance for clinical and public health interventions. This communication aims to provide an overview of challenges for understanding child malnutrition from a perspective of predictive modeling focusing on well-documented seasonal variations in nutritional outcomes and exploring ``the systems approach'' to tackle underlining conceptual and practical complexities to forecast seasonal malnutrition in an accurate and timely manner. This generalized approach to forecasting seasonal malnutrition is then applied specifically to child acute malnutrition.},

Mean daily energy intakes varied from 1520 kcal/woman in February (rainy season) to 2250 kcal/woman in April (post-harvest period). On average, maize provided two-thirds (63\%) of the energy. Other important sources were roots and tubers (11\%), fish (5\%), fruit (4\%), legumes (4\%) and vegetables (3\%). The rainy season decrease in energy intakes was associated with a marked reduction in the consumption of roots and tubers, fruit, legumes and vegetables.

This model was tested empirically for the Blantyre Shire Highlands using evidence from a panel survey and household case studies. Results showed no significant relationship between the supply of hired labour (ganyu) and the timeliness of weeding for maize, and that timely weeding was not a significant determinant of household maize deficits. This puzzle is explained by the diversification of the rural economy that has allowed households to develop alternative livelihood strategies to cope with maize deficits. Livelihood diversity helped poor households avoid the seasonal poverty trap and also helps explain the paradox of why the poorest region in Malawi escaped the 2001--2002 famine.},

Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative to expensive and time-consuming survey measurements by training models to predict economic conditions from freely available satellite imagery. However, previous efforts have failed to utilize the temporal information available in earth observation (EO) data, which may capture developments important to standards of living. In this work, we develop an EO-ML method for inferring neighborhood-level material-asset wealth using multi-temporal imagery and recurrent convolutional neural networks.1 Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in several aspects of generalization, explaining 72\% of the variance in wealth across held-out countries and 75\% held-out time spans. Using our geographically and temporally aware models, we created spatiotemporal material-asset data maps covering the entire continent of Africa from 1990 to 2019, making our data product the largest dataset of its kind. We showcase these results by analyzing which neighborhoods are likely to escape poverty by the year 2030, which is the deadline for when the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are evaluated. {\copyright} 2023 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Through the lens of a simple aggregate production function, human capital might increase output per capita by directly entering in the production process, incentivizing the accumulation of complementary inputs, and facilitating the adoption of new technologies. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of three approaches that have been used to evaluate the empirical importance of these channels: cross-country regressions, development accounting, and quantitative models. The key findings in the literature are reviewed and some of them are replicated using updated data. The bulk of the evidence suggests that human capital is an important determinant of cross-country income gaps, especially when its measurement is broadened to go beyond simple proxies of educational attainment.

Objective We investigated intervention-associated DNAm changes in children whose mothers participated in 2 randomized controlled trials of micronutrient supplementation before and during pregnancy, as part of the EMPHASIS (Epigenetic Mechanisms linking Preconceptional nutrition and Health Assessed in India and sub-Saharan Africa) study (ISRCTN14266771). Design We conducted epigenome-wide association studies with blood samples from Indian (n = 698) and Gambian (n = 293) children using the Illumina EPIC array and a targeted study of selected loci not on the array. The Indian micronutrient intervention was food based, whereas the Gambian intervention was a micronutrient tablet. Results We identified 6 differentially methylated CpGs in Gambians [2.5--5.0\% reduction in intervention group, all false discovery rate (FDR) {$<$}5\%], the majority mapping to ESM1,which also represented a strong signal in regional analysis. One CpG passed FDR {$<$}5\% in the Indian cohort, but overall effect sizes were small ({$<$}1\%) and did not have the characteristics of a robust signature. We also found strong evidence for enrichment of metastable epialleles among subthreshold signals in the Gambian analysis. This supports the notion that multiple methylation loci are influenced by micronutrient supplementation in the early embryo. Conclusions Maternal preconceptional and pregnancy micronutrient supplementation may alter DNAm in children measured at 7--9 y. Multiple factors, including differences between the nature of the intervention, participants, and settings, are likely to have contributed to the lack of replication in the Indian cohort. Potential links to phenotypic outcomes will be explored in the next stage of the EMPHASIS study.},

  abstract = {Identifying the locations and footprints of buildings is vital for many practical and scientific purposes. Such information can be particularly useful in developing regions where alternative data sources may be scarce. In this work, we describe a model training pipeline for detecting buildings across the entire continent of Africa, using 50 cm satellite imagery. Starting with the U-Net model, widely used in satellite image analysis, we study variations in architecture, loss functions, regularization, pre-training, self-training and post-processing that increase instance segmentation performance. Experiments were carried out using a dataset of 100k satellite images across Africa containing 1.75M manually labelled building instances, and further datasets for pre-training and self-training. We report novel methods for improving performance of building detection with this type of model, including the use of mixup (mAP +0.12) and self-training with soft KL loss (mAP +0.06). The resulting pipeline obtains good results even on a wide variety of challenging rural and urban contexts, and was used to create the Open Buildings dataset of 516M Africa-wide detected footprints.},

abstract = {Cloud cover is a major limiting factor in exploiting time-series data acquired by optical spaceborne remote sensing sensors. Multiple methods have been developed to address the problem of cloud detection in satellite imagery and a number of cloud masking algorithms have been developed for optical sensors but very few studies have carried out quantitative intercomparison of state-of-the-art methods in this domain. This paper summarizes results of the first Cloud Masking Intercomparison eXercise (CMIX) conducted within the Committee Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). CEOS is the forum for space agency coordination and cooperation on Earth observations, with activities organized under working groups. CMIX, as one such activity, is an international collaborative effort aimed at intercomparing cloud detection algorithms for moderate-spatial resolution (10–30 m) spaceborne optical sensors. The focus of CMIX is on open and free imagery acquired by the Landsat 8 (NASA/USGS) and Sentinel-2 (ESA) missions. Ten algorithms developed by nine teams from fourteen different organizations representing universities, research centers and industry, as well as space agencies (CNES, ESA, DLR, and NASA), are evaluated within the CMIX. Those algorithms vary in their approach and concepts utilized which were based on various spectral properties, spatial and temporal features, as well as machine learning methods. Algorithm outputs are evaluated against existing reference cloud mask datasets. Those datasets vary in sampling methods, geographical distribution, sample unit (points, polygons, full image labels), and generation approaches (experts, machine learning, sky images). Overall, the performance of algorithms varied depending on the reference dataset, which can be attributed to differences in how the reference datasets were produced. The algorithms were in good agreement for thick cloud detection, which were opaque and had lower uncertainties in their identification, in contrast to thin/semi-transparent clouds detection. Not only did CMIX allow identification of strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms and potential areas of improvements, but also the problems associated with the existing reference datasets. The paper concludes with recommendations on generating new reference datasets, metrics, and an analysis framework to be further exploited and additional input datasets to be considered by future CMIX activities.}

Many of these antipoverty programs involve some degree of geographic targeting, where aid is prioritized to the poorest regions of the country. However, policy makers in many low-resource settings lack the disaggregated poverty data required to make effective geographic targeting decisions. Using several independent datasets from Nigeria, this paper shows that high-resolution poverty maps, constructed by applying machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery and other nontraditional geospatial data, can improve the targeting of government cash transfers to poor families. Specifically, we find that geographic targeting relying on machine learning--based poverty maps can reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion relative to geographic targeting based on recent nationally representative survey data. This result holds for antipoverty programs that target both the poor and the extreme poor and for initiatives of varying sizes. We also find no evidence that machine learning--based maps increase targeting disparities by demographic groups, such as gender or religion. Based in part on these findings, the Government of Nigeria used this approach to geographically target emergency cash transfers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

To resolve this puzzling contrast, we differentiate average human capital (literacy) from upper-tail knowledge. As a proxy for the historical presence of knowledge elites, we use city-level subscriptions to the famous Encyclop{\'e}die in mid-18th century France. We show that subscriber density is a strong predictor of city growth after the onset of French industrialization. Alternative measures of development such as soldier height, disposable income, and industrial activity confirm this pattern. Initial literacy levels, on the other hand, are associated with development in the cross-section, but they do not predict growth. Finally, by joining data on British patents with a large French firm survey from the 1840s, we shed light on the mechanism: upper-tail knowledge raised productivity in innovative industrial technology.},

Identifying actions that mitigate the adverse effects of weather shocks on schooling, therefore, is critical for sustaining equitable human capital formation. In this paper, we use four waves of household and community panel survey data, merged with long-term, spatially explicit rainfall data to investigate whether access to school feeding programmes (SFP) in Malawi supports primary school enrolment when negative rainfall shocks occur. We find some evidence that access to SFP increases enrolment for older children when their households experience anomalously low rainfall conditions compared to those without SFP. The positive associations of SFP on enrolment persist when we consider historical shocks over longer periods. When we disaggregate by sex, however, there are no differentials. The findings suggest that SFPs, already a common intervention in many contexts, may have modest potential for improving primary school completion rates, educational advancement and human capital formation in the context of a rapidly changing climate.},

We reviewed published evidence and present new data from low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries on the timing and importance of preconception health for subsequent maternal and child health. We describe the extent to which pregnancy is planned, and whether planning is linked to preconception health behaviours. Observational studies show strong links between health before pregnancy and maternal and child health outcomes, with consequences that can extend across generations, but awareness of these links is not widespread. Poor nutrition and obesity are rife among women of reproductive age, and differences between high-income and low-income countries have become less distinct, with typical diets falling far short of nutritional recommendations in both settings and especially among adolescents. Several studies show that micronutrient supplementation starting in pregnancy can correct important maternal nutrient deficiencies, but effects on child health outcomes are disappointing. Other interventions to improve diet during pregnancy have had little effect on maternal and newborn health outcomes. Comparatively few interventions have been made for preconception diet and lifestyle. Improvements in the measurement of pregnancy planning have quantified the degree of pregnancy planning and suggest that it is more common than previously recognised. Planning for pregnancy is associated with a mixed pattern of health behaviours before conception. We propose novel definitions of the preconception period relating to embryo development and actions at individual or population level. A sharper focus on intervention before conception is needed to improve maternal and child health and reduce the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Alongside continued efforts to reduce smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity in the population, we call for heightened awareness of preconception health, particularly regarding diet and nutrition. Importantly, health professionals should be alerted to ways of identifying women who are planning a pregnancy.},

  abstract = {In this paper we review the associations between maternal and child undernutrition with human capital and risk of adult diseases in low-income and middle-income countries. We analysed data from five long-standing prospective cohort studies from Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa and noted that indices of maternal and child undernutrition (maternal height, birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction, and weight, height, and body-mass index at 2 years according to the new WHO growth standards) were related to adult outcomes (height, schooling, income or assets, offspring birthweight, body-mass index, glucose concentrations, blood pressure). We undertook systematic reviews of studies from low-income and middle-income countries for these outcomes and for indicators related to blood lipids, cardiovascular disease, lung and immune function, cancers, osteoporosis, and mental illness. Undernutrition was strongly associated, both in the review of published work and in new analyses, with shorter adult height, less schooling, reduced economic productivity, and---for women---lower offspring birthweight. Associations with adult disease indicators were not so clear-cut. Increased size at birth and in childhood were positively associated with adult body-mass index and to a lesser extent with blood pressure values, but not with blood glucose concentrations. In our new analyses and in published work, lower birthweight and undernutrition in childhood were risk factors for high glucose concentrations, blood pressure, and harmful lipid profiles once adult body-mass index and height were adjusted for, suggesting that rapid postnatal weight gain---especially after infancy---is linked to these conditions. The review of published works indicates that there is insufficient information about long-term changes in immune function, blood lipids, or osteoporosis indicators. Birthweight is positively associated with lung function and with the incidence of some cancers, and undernutrition could be associated with mental illness. We noted that height-for-age at 2 years was the best predictor of human capital and that undernutrition is associated with lower human capital. We conclude that damage suffered in early life leads to permanent impairment, and might also affect future generations. Its prevention will probably bring about important health, educational, and economic benefits. Chronic diseases are especially common in undernourished children who experience rapid weight gain after infancy.},

Two key questions challenging governments were: how long would the high prices last and with what effects on food security and nutrition over the longer run? This paper considers the drivers of the crisis and explores if, unlike past shocks, the recent price increases reflect structural changes in food price formation that will have lasting global implications. New cross-commodity relationships allowed prices to spike, although there was no shortage of food at the global level nor indeed a significant downturn in recent yields. Yet recent record levels of farm production were also mirrored by growing numbers of people chronically undernourished and/or micronutrient deficient. The gap between supply and need was underpinned by growing urban demand, consumption of processed and higher-value foods (including meat), biofuel policy, and purchasing power erosion, but also by short-term market-distorting policies implemented by governments responding to perceived shortages of food. Thus, the impact of future food price crises will depend largely on what policymakers chose to do in response to the peaks and what they do not do during the troughs. Appropriate investments are urgently needed not just in smallholder developing country agriculture, but in effective food policies and targeted programming that can reverse the recent negative trends in nutrition and that support access globally to improved diet quality as well as food quantity.},

abstract = {African cities are growing rapidly and more than half of their populations live in deprived areas. Local stakeholders urgently need accurate, granular, and routine maps to plan, upgrade, and monitor dynamic neighborhood-level changes. Satellite imagery provides a promising solution for consistent, accurate high-resolution maps globally. However, most studies use very high spatial resolution images, which often cover only small areas and are cost prohibitive. Additionally, model transferability to new cities remains uncertain. This study proposes a scalable and transferable approach to routinely map deprived areas using free, Sentinel-2 images. The models were trained and tested on three cities: Lagos (Nigeria), Accra (Ghana), and Nairobi (Kenya). Contextual features were extracted at 10 m spatial resolution and aggregated to a 100 m grid. Four machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The scalability of model performance was examined using patches of the different deprived types identified through visual image interpretation. The study also tested the ability of models to map deprived areas of different types across cities. Results indicate that deprived areas have heterogeneous local characteristics that affect large area mapping. The top 25 features for each city show that models are sensitive to the spatial structures of deprived area types. While models performed well on individual cities with XGBoost and MLP achieving an F1 scores of over 80%, the generalized model proves to be more beneficial for modeling multiple cities. This approach offers a promising solution for scaling routine, accurate maps of deprived areas to hundreds of cities that currently lack any such map, supporting local stakeholders to plan, implement, and monitor geotargeted interventions.}

  note         = {xr\_fresh is designed to quickly generate a broad set of temporal features from gridded raster data time series. This package works only with single band images, not multiband (e.g., RGB) formats. It leverages Python and xarray for analyzing time-series characteristics from raster data as generated by geowombat. Capabilities include feature extraction, dimension reduction, and application of machine learning techniques for geospatial data. Input data: historical raster data (e.g., Monthly temperature data from 2000-2018). Output: rasters with features as columns or raster file with features as bands.}
