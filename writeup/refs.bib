  note         = {xr\_fresh is designed to quickly generate a broad set of temporal features from gridded raster data time series. This package works only with single band images, not multiband (e.g., RGB) formats. It leverages Python and xarray for analyzing time-series characteristics from raster data as generated by geowombat. Capabilities include feature extraction, dimension reduction, and application of machine learning techniques for geospatial data. Input data: historical raster data (e.g., Monthly temperature data from 2000-2018). Output: rasters with features as columns or raster file with features as bands.}
