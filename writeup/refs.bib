abstract = {Deep learning (DL) algorithms have seen a massive rise in popularity for remote-sensing image analysis over the past few years. In this study, the major DL concepts pertinent to remote-sensing are introduced, and more than 200 publications in this field, most of which were published during the last two years, are reviewed and analyzed. Initially, a meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the status of remote sensing DL studies in terms of the study targets, DL model(s) used, image spatial resolution(s), type of study area, and level of classification accuracy achieved. Subsequently, a detailed review is conducted to describe/discuss how DL has been applied for remote sensing image analysis tasks including image fusion, image registration, scene classification, object detection, land use and land cover (LULC) classification, segmentation, and object-based image analysis (OBIA). This review covers nearly every application and technology in the field of remote sensing, ranging from preprocessing to mapping. Finally, a conclusion regarding the current state-of-the art methods, a critical conclusion on open challenges, and directions for future research are presented.}

abstract = {With many platforms and sensors continuously observing the earth surface, the large amount of remote sensing data presents a big data challenge. While remote sensing data acquisition capability can fully meet the requirements of many application domains, there is still a need to further explore how to efficiently mine the useful information from remote sensing big data (RSBD). Many researchers in the remote sensing community have introduced deep learning in the process of RSBD, and deep learning-based methods have achieved better performance compared with traditional methods. However, there are still substantial obstacles to the application of deep learning in remote sensing. One of the major challenges is the generation of pixel-level labels with high quality for training samples, which is essential to deep learning models. Weakly supervised deep learning (WSDL) is a promising solution to address this problem as WSDL can utilize greedily labeled datasets that are easy to collect but not ideal to train the deep networks. In this review, we summarize the achievements of WSDL-driven cost-efficient information extraction from RSBD. We first analyze the opportunities and challenges of information extraction from RSBD. Based on the analysis of the theoretical foundations of WSDL in the computer vision (CV) domain, we conduct a survey on the WSDL-based information extraction methods under the data characteristic and task demand of RSBD in four different tasks: (i) scene classification, (ii) object detection, (iii) semantic segmentation and (iv) change detection. Finally, potential research directions are outlined to guide researchers to further exploit WSDL-based information extraction from RSBD.}

ABSTRACT = {For agronomic, environmental, and economic reasons, the need for spatialized information about agricultural practices is expected to rapidly increase. In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories of practices: crop succession (crop rotation and fallowing), cropping pattern (single tree crop planting pattern, sequential cropping, and intercropping/agroforestry), and cropping techniques (irrigation, soil tillage, harvest and post-harvest practices, crop varieties, and agro-ecological infrastructures). We observed that the majority of the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the new spatial technologies, and particularly the Sentinel constellation, are expected to improve the monitoring of cropping practices in the challenging context of food security and better management of agro-environmental issues.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the use of remote sensing data obtained from satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery has grown in popularity for crop classification tasks such as yield prediction, soil classification or crop mapping. The ready availability of information, with improved temporal, radiometric, and spatial resolution, has resulted in the accumulation of vast amounts of data. Meeting the demands of analysing this data requires innovative solutions, and artificial intelligence techniques offer the necessary support. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for crop classification using remote sensing data from aerial imagery. The reviewed papers focus on a variety of deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks, transformers, and hybrid CNN-recurrent neural network models, and incorporate techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and multimodal fusion to improve model performance. The review analyses the use of these techniques to boost crop classification accuracy by developing new deep learning architectures or by combining various types of remote sensing data. Additionally, it assesses the impact of factors like spatial and spectral resolution, image annotation, and sample quality on crop classification. Ensembling models or integrating multiple data sources tends to enhance the classification accuracy of deep learning models. Satellite imagery is the most commonly used data source due to its accessibility and typically free availability. The study highlights the requirement for large amounts of training data and the incorporation of non-crop classes to enhance accuracy and provide valuable insights into the current state of deep learning models and datasets for crop classification tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning (DL) has a wide variety of applications in the geospatial and remote sensing (RS) sciences, and consequently has been a focus of many recent studies. However, a review of accuracy assessment methods used in recently published RS DL studies, focusing on scene classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, indicates that RS DL papers appear to follow an accuracy assessment approach that diverges from that of traditional RS studies. Papers reporting on RS DL studies have largely abandoned traditional RS accuracy assessment terminology; they rarely reported a complete confusion matrix; and sampling designs and analysis protocols generally did not provide a population-based confusion matrix, in which the table entries are estimates of the probabilities of occurrence of the mapped landscape. These issues indicate the need for the RS community to develop guidance on best practices for accuracy assessment for CNN-based DL thematic mapping and object detection. As a first step in that process, we explore key issues, including the observation that accuracy assessments should not be biased by the CNN-based training and inference processes that rely on image chips. Furthermore, accuracy assessments should be consistent with prior recommendations and standards in the field, should support the estimation of a population confusion matrix, and should allow for assessment of model generalization. This paper draws from our review of the RS DL literature and the rich record of traditional remote sensing accuracy assessment research while considering the unique nature of CNN-based deep learning to propose accuracy assessment best practices that use appropriate sampling methods, training and validation data partitioning, assessment metrics, and reporting standards.},
