# Introduction
## Background and Context

├── Background and Context
|    ├── Overview of Remote Sensing Technology
|    └── Applications in [specific field or topic] -->
The free access to remotely sensed data, such as imagery from satellites (e.g. Sentinel-2, LandSat) has revolutionized the field of crop type classification in developing countries. By leveraging the power of advanced imaging technologies combined with machine learning algorithms, researchers and practitioners can now identify and map different crop types over large geographic areas at low cost. This has the potential to improve food security, land use planning, and agricultural policy in regions where ground-based data collection is limited or non-existent.

<!-- ├── Problem Statement
|    ├── Current Challenges
|    └── Research Need -->
The collection of field observations and ground truth data is a critical input to the development of machine learning models for crop type classification. However, obtaining accurate and timely ground truth data can be challenging in developing countries due to limited resources, infrastructure, and capacity. In many cases, researchers rely on crowdsourced data from volunteers or citizen scientists to supplement or validate ground truth data collected through traditional methods. Projects like [@tseng2021cropharvest] point to the near complete lack of multi-class crop type datasets globally. This is a significant gap in the field of crop type classification, as the availability of high-quality training data is essential for the development of accurate and reliable machine learning models.
